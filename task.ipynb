    "# Title: Build a Financial Insights Dashboard and Scoring Model\n",
    "### Assignment Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Data Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Analyze the dataset to:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Identify family-level and member-level spending patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Understand correlations between financial metrics (e.g., income vs.\n",
    "expenses, savings vs. spending habits).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. Build a Financial Scoring Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Develop a scoring mechanism (range: 0–100) to evaluate each family's financial\n",
    "health.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Factors to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Savings-to-Income Ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Monthly Expenses as a percentage of Income.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Loan Payments as a percentage of Income.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Credit Card Spending trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Spending category distribution (e.g., higher travel/entertainment\n",
    "spending lowers the score).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "• Financial Goals Met (%).\n",
    "\n",
    "• Provide a justification for the scoring logic and weights assigned to each\n",
    "factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. Insights Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Use Python with Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to visualize:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Spending distribution across categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Family-wise financial scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Member-wise spending trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Include at least 3 meaningful visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. Deploy the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Use Flask or FastAPI to expose the scoring model as an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Input: Family-level and transaction data for a family.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Output: Financial score and key insights (e.g., \"Savings are below\n",
    "recommended levels, which affects your score by X points\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bonus Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a simple Streamlit or Dash app to allow interaction with the scoring model\n",
    "and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide recommendations for improving financial scores (e.g., \"Reduce discretionary\n",
    "spending by 10% to improve your score by X points\").\n",
    "Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Python Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Include a Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts with:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Data cleaning and preprocessing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Scoring model implementation and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "• API:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Deploy a Flask/FastAPI app for testing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "• README with setup instructions and explanation of model logic."
